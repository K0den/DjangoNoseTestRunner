Upgrade notes (2013-05-16)
==========================

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY BREAK: if you're using nosetests, you'll need to
add "use-node" key to your `django-nose-test` settings:

    {
        "folders": [ ... ],
        "settings":
        {
            "django-nose-test": {
                "use-nose": true,
                [ ... ]
            }
        }
    }

New feature: running the tests using standard Django's test runner is now
supported, and is the default.
